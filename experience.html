            "Christy Hernandez is a SAFe certified advanced level scrum master with proven abilities to guide and coach scrum teams to higher performance. She is very thorough and meticulous, produces high quality of work, delivers on time, maintains healthy relationships with everyone, volunteers for extra work, and engages extensively with the agile community of practice. She has earned my utmost trust with her sincerity, dedication, and commitment. I never followed up on anything with her. Once I assign any task or target to her, she makes it her own task and target and gets it done the best way in the quickest time. Christy has earned the trust and respect of all her scrum teams, fellow scrum masters, product owners, and the leaders too in the organization. She is an immensely valuable asset to the company.. I am very proud of her."-<i>Prem Misha, Executive Coach </i></blockquote>

            It is with great pleasure that I write this recommendation for Christy Hernandez. Throughout our time working together, I have consistently found her to be an absolute joy to work with. 

            Not only does she excel in her own tasks, but she also takes the time to mentor and support her colleagues, myself included. Whenever I encountered challenges, she was always there to lend a helping hand, often going above and beyond by scheduling time to address any issues I faced.

            At the time she was our teamâ€™s Scrum Master she was a true advocate for our team. She consistently strived to foster an environment of respect and collaboration, encouraging us all to work together harmoniously.
            
            Christy is the embodiment of a lifelong learner, constantly seeking out new knowledge and skills to further her expertise. Our conversations are always enriched by her eagerness to explore new technical concepts and expand her technical skills.
            
            Any organization would be incredibly fortunate to have her as part of their team. Her dedication, expertise, and positive attitude make her an invaluable asset to any organization. -<i>Ralph Gagerie, Implementation Analyst</i></blockquote>
